Details About WorldVisitz

Background

WorldVisitz is a travel agency. WorldVisitz has engaged you as an agile consultant and coach to launch their mobile application solution. This solution will allow customers to book travel with all major airlines. The mobile application will leverage predictive analytics to try and upsell additional travel related services and offerings.

The executives have advised you they are concerned that the current detailed requirements and specifications document has an 18 monthsâ€™ estimate for project delivery. They have heard that an Agile approach might help WorldVisitz monetize offerings sooner incrementally.

WorldVisitz executives want you to define an Agile delivery solution to replace their current inefficient traditional product development processes.

The executives are concerned about the current lack of knowledge transfer between team members, as well as not adhering to coding standards. They have also been hearing of a lack of trust and camaraderie between the offshore and onshore resources.
